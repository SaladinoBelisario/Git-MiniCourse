## And then Git

Some goals that Git was born with are:
- Speed
- Simple design
- Strong support for non-linear development (thousands of parallel branches)
- Fully distributed
- Able to handle large projects like Linux kernel efficiently (speed and data size)

Git was born out of a Linux dispute, because the VCS that was used to maintain the
kernel code was proprietary and when there were differences they took away its financial
support. So Linus Torvalds started to making its own VCS (Git).
