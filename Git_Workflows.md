## Git Workflows

### Why the workflow matters?

The workflow is how your team is going to work, so you can figure out that selecting a workflow
it's not a trivial task, you want your team to be more productive, not to waste the time of your
people only to look like a fancy software team.

The most important thing is to consider the culture of your team. You want the workflow to 
improve the efficiency of your team, not a burden that limits productivity. Here are some 
questions you need to keep in mind when evaluating a Git workflow:

- How well scales this workflow with my team?
- Is it easy to undo mistakes and glitches with this workflow?
- Does this workflow impose cognitive excesses on the team?
