## General Index
- Getting Started
    * Installing git
        Doing installation test
    * What it's git?
        Is a version control software that allows you to work from different devices to improve workflow in team projects
    * Why git?
        Git doesn't store the modified file again, but instead creates a link to the previous identical file that it has already stored by
        generating a snapshot stream
    * How it works? (A first approach)
        * Most git operations only need local files and resources to work
        * Everything in Git it's verificated before being stored and then referred to by that verification sum
        * Most of the actions in git just add data to the git database
    * Your first setup
        * git config –list –show-origin
        * git config --global user.name "John Doe“
        * git config --global user.email johndoe@example.com
        * git config --global core.editor "'C:/Program Files/Notepad++/notepad++.exe' -multiInst -notabbar -nosession -noPlugin"
